							<p>This project started as a testing ground for a dialogue asset called VIDE DIALOGUES and wasn't supposed to become a game but I am happy it did, albeit a small one. I wanted to try narrative design but VIDE DIALOGUES wasn't what I was looking for in the end, so there isn't much dialogue left in the game.
								 Since it was close to Halloween I built up a spooky scene to play around with. A fellow creator was kind enough to take a look at what I had going on at that point so he jumped on aboard and created a suitable Character and Narrative that was small enough to get finished by Halloween. I did the rest. When I got stuck with a piece of code IrishJohnGames came to the rescue.</p>

							<p> Even though free the VIDE DIALOGUES system were very poorly documented so I broke apart its demo scene which had interactions already set up. What I had to do next was hook up a better controller to the one VIDE had for which I chose the basic asset one that comes with unity. That proved to be a bit tricky but I got it going in the end. After the character was moving smoothly I dove into the VIDE EDITOR that lets you craft dialogue trees.
								It proved to be a bit tricky to handle, save and manipulate dialogues that were already attached to the character. I would consider trying a more robust dialogue system next time. </p>

							<p>Main mechanic of the game is collecting Halloween candies. The placement of the candies you can see down bellow. I tried covering the entire map, placing just enough for the game not to get dull. The game can be played in browser but I recommend downloading it. </p>
